# export_stl_openfoam
The code is written based on the offical blender addon import-export STL format, written by Guillaume Bouchard.

This Blender addon exports Object in ASCII STL-file format for OpenFOAM. You can select multi-objects and save them in one stl file. 
Also you will be able to scale the objects and apply modifiers during exporting. 
Remember this addon scales the objects from the base coordinate system.

Another feature of this addon is ability of changing object orientation during exporting.
